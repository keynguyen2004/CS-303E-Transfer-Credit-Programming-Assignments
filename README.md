# AS-A-Level-Computer-Science-Programming-Assignments

I've selected a few programming assignments for each programming topic that best highlight the topic. Therefore, the assignment doesn't reflect the order in which I learn those topics, and the number of each programming topic is use for categorizing purpose only. Furthermore, the programming assignments might overlap several programming topics.

If there're insufficient programming assignments for a certain programming topic, feel free to contact me at nguyenminhvinhky@utexas.edu so that I can provide you with more programming assignments on that topic.

Many thanks, Ky
