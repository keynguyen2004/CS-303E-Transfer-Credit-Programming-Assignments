"""
Insertion sort follow these 5 steps

    1. Set the first element to be the sorted list  
    2. Store the next element in a temporary variable // 
       store the value to be sorted in a temporary variable 
    3. â€¦ compare this next element to each element in the sorted list  
    4. Move the elements that are greater/less than it one space to 
       the right and insert the temporary variable // swap the element 
       down until in the correct positions  
    5. Loop through all items from 2nd to end of array
